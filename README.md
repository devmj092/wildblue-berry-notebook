# Wild-Bluberry-Prediction ( A ML project Under GLP)
This Notebook is benificail for anyone who Just started Machine Learning!
As I am going to implement ML models on different dataset under GLP Program Taught by Mam AqsaQadir. <br><hr>
As a complete bigneer in AI, I was taught well under GLP program and now I'm able to do following steps to some extent:
+ EDA
+ Preprocessing
+ Baseline Modeling
+ Hyperparameter Tunning
+ Deployment On Streamlit
## EDA
To explore dataset I used Autoviz, Autoviz is a Python library for automatic visualization that can generate various types of charts based on a given dataset. It gives alot of infoemation about 
dataset like data shape, data types, reltionship between target variable & other variables. It also provide heatmap for numeric data present in dataset.

## Preprocessing
In this step I removed null values and handle outliers, Also shrink data by cutting out highly corelated columns shown by Autoviz. 

## Baseline Modeling
I train & test data on 3 different models:
+ Linear Regression Model
+ Randomforest Model
+ Decision Tree Model

RMSE was evaluating Score for the models and Linear Regreesion model RMSE value was good among these 3 models.

## HyperParameter Tunning
I used Grid Search CV for hyperparameter tunning!

## Deployment
This is my first ML project that I am deploying on streamlit!
